# cpp_reverse_string_recursion
The Reverse String Recursion Program (C++) asks the user to enter a string, which is passed to a void recursive function that displays the string in reverse order. 

Test the program with a palindrome to see how it works! For example, "RACECAR" should print an output of "RACECAR".
